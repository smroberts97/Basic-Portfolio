            Hi! I am new at learning web development. I truly believe this is an industry of the future. I was inspired while watching my kids learning to code at school. I am excited to be learning a new skill that will logically dovetail with my background. I am a process improvement expert, trained in the Six Sigma methodology by GE Healthcare. I started my professional career in healthcare, at a large hospital system in Charleston, West Virginia. I was selected to become part of the Process Improvement team which would be tasked with rolling out the Six Sigma methodology throughout the hospital system. I had the opportunity to train as a Black Belt and eventually become a Master Black Belt. My main projects during that time was improving Emergency Department wait time, as well as Patient Throughput in the healthcare system. I also worked in Human Resources to improve their application process, and in the CardioVascular Operating Room to improve teamwork and process flow in the OR. Our largest project was the automation of the entire hospital's medical records to convert them to electronic records, or EMR. I was on the team that explored in-depth, several outsourcing companies, such as Siemens and McKesson. Our department's job was to optimize the existing process to be technology ready. Currently I work for my own company, and I focus on process improvement, typically in small businesses. I have found that in the process improvement industry, many of the solutions are electronic and web based software. In order for me to be able to offer the companies I work for a wider skill set, I am excited to dive deeper into the understanding and inner workings of the web and software development.

            I am a mom of two, and I live in Vero Beach Florida with my husband, kids, dog, cats, and gerbil. I enjoy photography, running, swimming, triathlon, stand-up paddleboarding, fishing, and yoga. My favorite sport is watching my kids' swim meets, baseball games and dance competitions. Our family makes frequent trips to Disney, but we also like to camp and travel to adventurous outdoor locations.
